# homework_2_produces_summary_txt
should successfully produce summary.txt file.
This should have the correct traveling salesman chromosome implementation in Chromo, 
and the correct fitness function representation in pointscatter.java.
I still haven't renamed pointscatter.java to travelingsalesman.java or scatter_params.params 
or scatter summary to traveling.params or traveling summary
but it should correctly implement traveling salesman (without any mutation or crossover)
and generate summary.txt.
Also, in scatter_params, the "fitness scaling type" can be changed for either maximization or minimization.
In our case, we want to minimize the total route so we want minimization.
You should be able to change population size or some other parameters and it should
still work and print out summary.txt.
